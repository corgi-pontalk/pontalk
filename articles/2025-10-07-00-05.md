# Boost Your Day: 5 Simple Scripts to Automate Your Life Today

Welcome, aspiring productivity hackers! Have you ever found yourself doing the same repetitive tasks on your computer day after day? Copying files, renaming photos, or checking if your favorite website is online? What if I told you there’s a magical way to make your computer do these chores for you, leaving you more time for what truly matters? That magic is called **automation**, and it’s simpler than you think!

In this post, we're going to explore how even a little bit of coding can supercharge your daily routine. Don't worry if you're new to coding; we'll use simple examples and explain everything along the way. Get ready to write your first few "scripts" and unlock a whole new level of efficiency!

## What Exactly is a Script?

Before we dive into the fun stuff, let's quickly clarify what a "script" is in this context.

A **script** is essentially a set of instructions that you write for your computer to follow. Think of it like a recipe. You give the computer a list of steps, and it executes them one by one. Unlike big, complex software programs, scripts are usually shorter, simpler, and designed to perform specific, often repetitive, tasks. We'll be using Python, a very beginner-friendly programming language, for our examples.

## Why Automate? The Superpowers of Scripts

Automation isn't just for tech gurus; it's for everyone! Here are a few reasons why you should start scripting today:

*   **Save Time:** Free up precious minutes (or even hours!) that you spend on tedious, repetitive tasks.
*   **Reduce Errors:** Computers are much better at repeating tasks precisely than humans are, minimizing mistakes.
*   **Boost Consistency:** Ensure tasks are performed the same way every time.
*   **Learn a New Skill:** Gain valuable coding experience that can open up new opportunities.
*   **Feel Empowered:** There's a real sense of accomplishment when your computer does your bidding!

Ready to become a productivity wizard? Let's get started with five practical scripts you can write today!

## 1. The Smart File Organizer: Tidy Up Your Downloads Folder

Is your "Downloads" folder a chaotic mess? Do you have screenshots mixed with documents and installers? Let's create a script that automatically sorts your files into appropriate folders.

**What it does:** This script will scan a designated folder (like your Downloads) and move files (e.g., `images`, `documents`, `videos`) into organized subfolders.

**How it works:**
The script will look at the end part of a file's name, called its **extension** (like `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.mp4`). Based on this extension, it decides which folder to move the file into. If no specific folder exists, it can create one.

```python
import os
import shutil

# Define the folder you want to organize (e.g., your Downloads folder)
# IMPORTANT: Change this path to your actual Downloads directory!
source_folder = "/Users/yourusername/Downloads" # Example for macOS/Linux
# source_folder = "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Downloads" # Example for Windows

# Define your target folders and the file types they should contain
target_folders = {
    "Images": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tiff"],
    "Documents": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx", ".txt", ".rtf", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx"],
    "Videos": [".mp4", ".mov", ".avi", ".mkv"],
    "Audio": [".mp3", ".wav", ".aac"],
    "Archives": [".zip", ".rar", ".7z"],
    "Others": [] # For anything else
}

print(f"Starting to organize files in: {source_folder}")

# Loop through each item (file or folder) in the source_folder
for filename in os.listdir(source_folder):
    # Construct the full path to the file
    file_path = os.path.join(source_folder, filename)

    # Check if it's actually a file (not a subfolder)
    if os.path.isfile(file_path):
        # Get the file extension (e.g., ".jpg")
        file_extension = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()

        moved = False
        for folder_name, extensions in target_folders.items():
            if file_extension in extensions:
                # Create the target subfolder if it doesn't exist
                destination_path = os.path.join(source_folder, folder_name)
                os.makedirs(destination_path, exist_ok=True) # exist_ok=True means it won't throw an error if the folder already exists

                # Move the file
                shutil.move(file_path, destination_path)
                print(f"Moved '{filename}' to '{folder_name}'")
                moved = True
                break # Stop checking other folder types for this file

        if not moved:
            # If the file didn't match any specific category, move it to 'Others'
            destination_path = os.path.join(source_folder, "Others")
            os.makedirs(destination_path, exist_ok=True)
            shutil.move(file_path, destination_path)
            print(f"Moved '{filename}' to 'Others'")

print("File organization complete!")
```
**Explanation:**
*   `import os` and `import shutil`: These lines bring in Python's built-in tools for working with your computer's **operating system** (like Windows, macOS, Linux) and for moving/copying files.
*   `source_folder`: This is where your messy files are. **Remember to change this to your actual folder path!**
*   `target_folders`: This is a "dictionary" (a list of pairs) that maps a folder name (like "Images") to a list of file **extensions** (like ".jpg").
*   `os.listdir(source_folder)`: This command gets a list of all files and folders inside your `source_folder`.
*   `os.path.isfile(file_path)`: Checks if an item is a file.
*   `os.path.splitext(filename)[1]`: This cleverly pulls out the file extension (e.g., from "report.pdf", it gets ".pdf").
*   `os.makedirs(destination_path, exist_ok=True)`: Creates the destination folder if it doesn't already exist.
*   `shutil.move(file_path, destination_path)`: This is the command that actually moves the file from its current spot to the new, organized folder.

## 2. The Website Watcher: Check if Your Favorite Site is Up

Ever wonder if your personal blog is still online, or if a specific service is experiencing downtime? This script can quickly check a website's status for you.

**What it does:** Pings a website and tells you if it's reachable and responding correctly.

**How it works:**
This script uses a common method called an **HTTP request**. When your web browser visits a website, it sends an HTTP request. The website then sends back an **HTTP status code**, which tells your browser what happened (e.g., "200 OK" means success, "404 Not Found" means the page doesn't exist). Our script will do the same!

For this script, you'll need to install a special Python "library" called `requests`. It's like adding an extra tool to Python's toolbox.
Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
`pip install requests`

```python
import requests

def check_website_status(url):
    """Checks the HTTP status of a given URL."""
    try:
        # Make a GET request to the URL
        # A GET request is like asking the server for information
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=5) # timeout=5 means wait 5 seconds max for a response

        # Check the status code
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"✅ {url} is UP! Status Code: {response.status_code}")
        elif response.status_code >= 400:
            print(f"❌ {url} is DOWN or has an error. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
        else:
            print(f"⚠️ {url} returned an unusual status. Status Code: {response.status_code}")

    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        print(f"❌ {url} is DOWN (Connection Error).")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        print(f"❌ {url} is DOWN (Timeout Error).")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"❌ {url} is DOWN (An error occurred: {e}).")

# List of websites to check
websites_to_check = [
    "https://www.google.com",
    "https://www.nonexistent-website-12345.com", # This one should fail
    "https://www.example.com"
]

print("Checking website statuses...")
for site in websites_to_check:
    check_website_status(site)

print("Website checks complete!")
```

**Explanation:**
*   `import requests`: Imports the `requests` library we just installed.
*   `requests.get(url, timeout=5)`: This line sends the HTTP request to the `url`. `timeout=5` means it will wait a maximum of 5 seconds for a response.
*   `response.status_code`: This is the important part! It's a number indicating the request's outcome. `200` means everything is fine. Numbers starting with `4` or `5` (like `404` or `500`) usually mean there's a problem.
*   `try...except`: This is a way to handle potential errors gracefully. If the website doesn't respond or there's a network issue, the script won't crash; it will print an error message instead.

## 3. The Daily Journal Creator: Start Your Day with a Template

If you like to keep a daily log, journal, or simply need a template for your daily tasks, this script can create a pre-filled file for you every morning.

**What it does:** Generates a new text file (or Markdown file) with the current date as its name and includes a basic template inside.

**How it works:**
The script will get today's date using Python's built-in date tools. It then uses this date to name a new file and writes some pre-defined text into it.

```python
import datetime
import os

def create_daily_journal():
    """Creates a new journal file with today's date and a template."""
    # Get today's date
    today = datetime.date.today()
    # Format the date into a string like "2023-10-27"
    date_str = today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    # Define where you want to save your journals
    journal_folder = "/Users/yourusername/Documents/DailyJournals" # Change this!
    # journal_folder = "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents\\DailyJournals" # Example for Windows

    # Create the journal folder if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(journal_folder, exist_ok=True)

    # Define the filename (e.g., "2023-10-27_Journal.md")
    filename = f"{date_str}_Journal.md"
    file_path = os.path.join(journal_folder, filename)

    # Check if the file already exists to avoid overwriting
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        print(f"Journal for {date_str} already exists: {file_path}")
        return

    # Define your journal template
    journal_content = f"""# Daily Journal - {date_str}

## What did I accomplish today?
- 

## What challenges did I face?
- 

## What am I planning for tomorrow?
- 

## Notes/Thoughts:
- 
"""
    # Open the file in write mode ('w') and write the content
    with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(journal_content)

    print(f"Created daily journal: {file_path}")

print("Generating daily journal...")
create_daily_journal()
print("Journal creation complete!")
```

**Explanation:**
*   `import datetime`: This imports Python's tools for working with dates and times.
*   `datetime.date.today()`: Gets the current date.
*   `strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`: Formats the date into a readable string (e.g., "2023-10-27").
*   `journal_folder`: **Remember to set this to where you want your journals to be saved!**
*   `with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:`: This is how Python opens a file. `'w'` means "write" (create a new file or overwrite an existing one). `encoding='utf-8'` handles different characters correctly. The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed afterwards.
*   `f.write(journal_content)`: Writes the defined `journal_content` into the newly created file.

## 4. The Batch Renamer: Tame Your Photo Collection

Got a folder full of photos from your vacation named `IMG_0001.jpg`, `IMG_0002.jpg`, etc.? This script can help you rename them all at once to something more descriptive, like `Vacation_Brazil_001.jpg`.

**What it does:** Renames multiple files in a specified folder by adding a prefix or changing a part of their name.

**How it works:**
The script will loop through all files in a folder. For each file, it will create a new name based on your rules and then rename the file.

```python
import os

def batch_rename_files(folder_path, prefix="Renamed_", start_number=1, extension_filter=None):
    """
    Renames files in a folder with a new prefix and sequential numbers.
    Optionally filters by file extension.
    """
    print(f"Starting batch rename in: {folder_path}")
    if not os.path.isdir(folder_path):
        print(f"Error: Folder not found at {folder_path}")
        return

    file_count = 0
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        old_file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)

        # Ensure it's a file and not a directory
        if os.path.isfile(old_file_path):
            name, ext = os.path.splitext(filename) # Separates "name" from ".ext"

            # Check if an extension filter is applied and if it matches
            if extension_filter and ext.lower() not in [e.lower() for e in extension_filter]:
                continue # Skip this file if its extension doesn't match the filter

            # Create the new filename
            new_filename = f"{prefix}{start_number:03d}{ext}" # :03d pads number with leading zeros (e.g., 001)
            new_file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, new_filename)

            # Avoid overwriting existing files with the same new name (though unlikely with sequence)
            if os.path.exists(new_file_path):
                print(f"Warning: New filename '{new_filename}' already exists, skipping '{filename}'.")
                continue

            try:
                os.rename(old_file_path, new_file_path)
                print(f"Renamed '{filename}' to '{new_filename}'")
                start_number += 1
                file_count += 1
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error renaming '{filename}': {e}")

    print(f"Batch rename complete! {file_count} files renamed.")

# IMPORTANT: Change this path to your actual folder with files!
my_photo_folder = "/Users/yourusername/Pictures/Vacation2023"
# my_photo_folder = "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Pictures\\Vacation2023" # Example for Windows

# Example usage:
# Rename all JPG/PNG files in 'my_photo_folder' with prefix 'Vacation_Brazil_' starting from 1
batch_rename_files(my_photo_folder, prefix="Vacation_Brazil_", start_number=1, extension_filter=[".jpg", ".png"])

# You could also rename all files without a filter:
# batch_rename_files(my_photo_folder, prefix="ProjectX_", start_number=1)
```

**Explanation:**
*   `os.listdir(folder_path)`: Lists all items in the given folder.
*   `os.path.splitext(filename)`: This is super useful! It splits a filename into two parts: the name itself and its **extension** (e.g., "myphoto" and ".jpg").
*   `f"{prefix}{start_number:03d}{ext}"`: This is an f-string, a modern way to create strings.
    *   `prefix`: The text you want to add at the beginning.
    *   `{start_number:03d}`: This takes `start_number` (like `1`, `2`, `3`) and formats it to always have three digits, padding with leading zeros if needed (`001`, `002`, `010`, `100`).
    *   `ext`: The original file extension.
*   `os.rename(old_file_path, new_file_path)`: This command does the actual renaming. Be careful with this one! Always test it on a copy of your files first.

## 5. The Clipboard Saver: Log Your Copied Text

Have you ever copied something important, only to accidentally copy something else and lose the first piece of text? This script can save everything you copy to a text file, creating a simple clipboard history.

**What it does:** Continuously monitors your clipboard and saves new text content to a log file.

**How it works:**
This script will periodically check what's currently on your computer's **clipboard** (the temporary storage where text goes when you copy it). If it finds new text, it adds it to a file.

For this, we'll need another library: `pyperclip`. It helps Python interact with your clipboard across different operating systems.
Install it:
`pip install pyperclip`

```python
import pyperclip
import time
import os

def monitor_clipboard_and_save():
    """Monitors the clipboard for new content and saves it to a file."""
    log_file_path = "clipboard_log.txt" # The file where copied text will be saved
    clipboard_history_folder = "/Users/yourusername/Documents/ClipboardLogs" # Change this!
    # clipboard_history_folder = "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents\\ClipboardLogs" # Example for Windows

    os.makedirs(clipboard_history_folder, exist_ok=True)
    full_log_path = os.path.join(clipboard_history_folder, log_file_path)

    # Stores the last copied content to compare against
    last_copied_content = ""

    print(f"Monitoring clipboard. New content will be saved to: {full_log_path}")
    print("Press Ctrl+C to stop the script.")

    try:
        while True:
            current_clipboard_content = pyperclip.paste() # Get current clipboard content

            if current_clipboard_content != last_copied_content and current_clipboard_content.strip() != "":
                # Only save if content is new and not empty (after removing leading/trailing spaces)
                timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
                with open(full_log_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f: # 'a' for append mode
                    f.write(f"--- {timestamp} ---\n")
                    f.write(current_clipboard_content + "\n\n")
                print(f"Saved new clipboard content at {timestamp}")
                last_copied_content = current_clipboard_content # Update last_copied_content

            time.sleep(2) # Wait for 2 seconds before checking again

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nClipboard monitoring stopped.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# This script needs to run continuously in your terminal.
# To stop it, go to your terminal and press Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac).
monitor_clipboard_and_save()
```

**Explanation:**
*   `import pyperclip`: Imports the library to interact with the clipboard.
*   `import time`: Imports tools for pausing the script.
*   `pyperclip.paste()`: This command retrieves whatever is currently copied to your clipboard.
*   `current_clipboard_content.strip() != ""`: Checks if the copied content isn't just empty spaces.
*   `with open(full_log_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:`: Opens the log file in **append mode** (`'a'`), meaning new content will be added to the end of the file, not overwrite it.
*   `time.sleep(2)`: Pauses the script for 2 seconds before checking the clipboard again. This prevents it from using too much computer power.
*   `try...except KeyboardInterrupt`: This is important! This script runs in a continuous **loop** (`while True`). `KeyboardInterrupt` catches when you press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal, allowing the script to stop gracefully instead of just crashing.
