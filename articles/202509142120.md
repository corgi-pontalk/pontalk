### Introduction

In an increasingly busy world, having tools to manage your tasks and projects is crucial for staying organized and productive. While many commercial productivity apps exist, building your own offers unparalleled customization and a deeper understanding of the underlying principles. This guide will walk you through creating a simple productivity application using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and SQLite, a lightweight, file-based database.

### Why Django and SQLite?

Choosing the right tools is the first step. Here's why Django and SQLite are an excellent combination for this project:

*   **Django:**
    *   **"Batteries Included":** Comes with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), an admin interface, authentication, and more, allowing for rapid development.
    *   **Scalability:** While we start small, Django's architecture makes it easy to scale your application as your needs grow.
    *   **Pythonic:** Leverages Python's readability and extensive ecosystem.
*   **SQLite:**
    *   **Serverless:** The database is a single file, meaning no separate database server process is needed.
    *   **Zero-Configuration:** Requires almost no setup, making it ideal for development, testing, and small-scale personal projects.
    *   **Default for Django:** Django uses SQLite as its default database, simplifying initial setup.

### Setting Up Your Django Project

Before we dive into coding, let's set up our development environment.

1.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended).
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** It's good practice to isolate your project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Django:**

    ```bash
    pip install Django
    ```

5.  **Start a New Django Project:** This creates the main project structure.

    ```bash
    django-admin startproject productivity_app .
    ```

6.  **Create an App:** Django projects are composed of reusable apps. Let's create one named `core`.

    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp core
    ```

7.  **Register Your App:** Open `productivity_app/settings.py` and add `'core'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

    ```python
    # productivity_app/settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'core', # Your new app
    ]
    ```

### Defining Your Models (Tasks & Projects)

Models are the heart of a Django application, defining the structure of your data. We'll create two models: `Project` and `Task`.

Open `core/models.py` and add the following:

```python
# core/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

class Project(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Task(models.Model):
    PRIORITY_CHOICES = [
        ('low', 'Low'),
        ('medium', 'Medium'),
        ('high', 'High'),
    ]

    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='tasks')
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    due_date = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
    priority = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=PRIORITY_CHOICES, default='medium')
    completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} ({self.project.name})"
```

*   `Project` has a `name` and an optional `description`.
*   `Task` has a `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `priority`, and a `completed` status.
*   The `project` field in `Task` creates a relationship (one-to-many) with the `Project` model, meaning one project can have many tasks. `on_delete=models.CASCADE` ensures that if a project is deleted, all associated tasks are also deleted.

### Database Migrations

After defining your models, you need to tell Django to create the corresponding tables in your database.

1.  **Create Migrations:** This generates the SQL commands based on your `models.py`.

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations core
    ```

2.  **Apply Migrations:** This executes the SQL commands against your SQLite database (which will be created as `db.sqlite3` in your project root if it doesn't exist).

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### Building the Admin Interface

Django's built-in admin interface is a powerful tool for managing your data without writing any frontend code.

1.  **Register Models:** Open `core/admin.py` and register your `Project` and `Task` models.

    ```python
    # core/admin.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Project, Task

    admin.site.register(Project)
    admin.site.register(Task)
    ```

2.  **Create a Superuser:** This account will allow you to log into the admin panel.

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

### Basic Views and Templates

Now, let's create a simple view to display our projects and tasks.

1.  **Define a View:** Open `core/views.py` and add a function to render a list of projects.

    ```python
    # core/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import Project, Task

    def project_list(request):
        projects = Project.objects.all().prefetch_related('tasks')
        return render(request, 'core/project_list.html', {'projects': projects})
    ```

    `prefetch_related('tasks')` optimizes database queries by fetching all related tasks for each project in a single query.

2.  **Create URLs for Your App:** In your `core` app, create a new file named `urls.py`.

    ```python
    # core/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.project_list, name='project_list'),
    ]
    ```

3.  **Include App URLs in Project URLs:** Open your main project's `urls.py` (`productivity_app/urls.py`) and include your `core` app's URLs.

    ```python
    # productivity_app/urls.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', include('core.urls')), # Include your app's URLs
    ]
    ```

4.  **Create a Template:** Inside your `core` app directory, create a folder named `templates`, and inside that, another folder named `core`. Inside `core/templates/core/`, create `project_list.html`.

    ```html
    <!-- core/templates/core/project_list.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My Productivity App</title>
        <style>
            body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; }
            h1, h2 { color: #333; }
            ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0; }
            li { background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; }
            li ul { margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 20px; border-top: 1px dashed #eee; padding-top: 10px; }
            li ul li { background-color: #fff; border: none; margin-bottom: 5px; padding: 5px; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Projects</h1>
        {% if projects %}
            <ul>
                {% for project in projects %}
                    <li>
                        <h2>{{ project.name }}</h2>
                        <p>{{ project.description|default:"No description provided." }}</p>
                        <h3>Tasks:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            {% for task in project.tasks.all %}
                                <li>
                                    <strong>{{ task.title }}</strong> - Due: {{ task.due_date|default:"N/A" }} - Priority: {{ task.priority|capfirst }} {% if task.completed %}(Completed){% endif %}
                                    <p>{{ task.description|default:"No task description." }}</p>
                                </li>
                            {% empty %}
                                <li>No tasks yet for this project.</li>
                            {% endfor %}
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        {% else %}
            <p>No projects found. Add some through the admin panel!</p>
        {% endif %}
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
